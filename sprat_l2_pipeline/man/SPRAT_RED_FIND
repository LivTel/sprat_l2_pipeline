Synopsis:

An automatic peak finding and centroiding routine for long-slit spectra.

Description:

The data are first binned along the dispersion axis (defined as x) with a bin size of [bin_size]
between the INTEGER limits [window_x_lo] and [window_x_hi]. Each bin is optionally detrended
along the spatial length of the slit with a [detrend_median_width_px] median filter. This allows
remove of slit-filling diffuse emission around the target before attempting to find the point source
at the slit centre. Set [detrend_median_width_px] to zero for no detrending, which is the case
for tracing the reference object.

A median filter of half-width [median_filter_width_px] pixels applied to smooth any erroneous data 
(e.g. cosmic rays, bad pixels).

If [detrend_median_width_px] has been set, the final detected object must be wider than 
[median_filter_width_px] but narrower than [detrend_median_width_px]. To find a very extended
source, you may need to set [detrend_median_width_px] = 0.

Both median filters are defined as half width ('radius') of the boxcar.

For each bin, an initial estimate of the mean/sd is found using the [bg_percentile]th lowest 
valued pixels. This mean/sd is then used in an iterative sigma clip with sigma [clip_sigma] to 
filter out target flux and obtain a truer background mean/sd. ([bg_percentile] is defined as
a simple fraction of the sorted pixel vaules. E.g, the median pixel value is for 0.5.)

The derivatives for each bin are found. Bins containing 
target flux are then identified by searching for data values which are greater than the product 
of the background sigma and [min_SNR]. If [min_spatial_width_px] values satisfying this criteria 
exist, then the bin is flagged as usable.

To obtain a better centroid for the peak, the most positive derivative is found between the 
spatial limits [finding_window_lo_px] and [finding_window_hi_px] and consecutive 
pixels (up to a maximum of [max_centering_num_px] pixels) are traversed until the turnover point 
is found i.e. when the sign of the derivative changes. If no such turnover is found, the bin is
disregarded. This pixel and [centroid_half_window_size_px] pixels either side are then used to
find the sub-pixel centroid of the peak by applying a second order parabolic fit.
 
Finally, the program will error if the number of usable bins is < [min_used_bins]. Output is 
passed to the [SPFIND_OUTPUTF_PEAKS_FILE] file.

spfind input_tr.fits 50 0 0.1 3 3 100 4 50 150 7 3 5 300 800
