Arc		Arc soectra for wavelengh calibration
Bias		Bias frames
Dark		Dark frames. We typically use 600sec
Flat		Flat fields for use of L1 pipeline. Both imaging and spectral frames
Continuum	Wlamp spectra with grating and slit IN. Used by L2 pipeline
Tram		"reference" spectra of a bright high S:N science target. Used by L2 to trace spectrum if science target is very low S:N
