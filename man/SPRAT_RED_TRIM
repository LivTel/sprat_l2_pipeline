Synopsis:

An automatic trimming routine to extract the active region from a long-slit exposure.

Description:

The data is first binned along the dispersion axis (defined as x) with a bin size of [bin_size]. 
An initial estimate of the mean/sd is found using the [bg_percentile]th lowest
valued pixels. This mean/sd is then used in an iterative sigma clip with sigma [clip_sigma]
and a mean background level obtained. The mean of this background level is then compared with 
the mean frame level, and a warning is given if the two are found to be of a similar magnitude, 
i.e. 

 bg_mean + bg_sd*[thresh_sigma] >= frame_mean

Edges are found in the data by progressing through each side of the spatial axis and finding the
pixels with the maximum/minimum derivatives. These peaks are then further tested by ascertaining 
if a window of size [scan_window_size_px] consecutive pixels all have values lying above 
[scan_window_trig_nsigma] * the background level standard deviation. This is done for every bin 
along the dispersion axis.

Finally, the automatically deduced width is checked to be greater than [min_spectrum_width].

Example: 

sptrim continuum.fits target.fits 20 0.1 1.0 3.0 100 1 100 out.fits
