Synopsis:

An automatic trimming routine to extract long-slit spectra.

Description:

The data is first binned along the dispersion axis (defined as x) with a bin size of [bin_size]. 
The resulting array is then filtered through an iterative sigma clip with sigma [clip_sigma] 
and a background level obtained.

Edges are found in the data by progressing through each side of the spatial axis and ascertaining 
if the current considered pixel and a window of size [scan_window_size_px] consecutive pixels all 
have values lying above [scan_window_trig_nsigma] * the background level standard deviation. This 
is done for every bin along the dispersion axis.

Finally, the automatically deduced width is checked to be greater than [min_spectrum_width].

Example: 

sptrim continuum.fits target.fits 0 200 0.1 100 5 215 out.fits
