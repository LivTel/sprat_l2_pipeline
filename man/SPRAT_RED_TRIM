Synopsis:

An automatic trimming routine to extract long-slit spectra.

Description:

The data is first binned along the dispersion axis (defined by setting [axis_scan_dir], where 0 
means the dispersion axis is along the x, and 1 means the dispersion axis is along the y) with 
a bin size of [bin_size]. the background level of resulting array is then obtained by finding the 
mean of the [bg_level_quantile]th lowest valued pixels.

Edges are found in the data by progressing through each side of the spatial axis and ascertaining 
if the current considered pixel and a window of size [scan_window_size_px] consecutive pixels all 
have values lying above [scan_window_trig_nsigma] * the background level standard deviation. This 
is done for every bin along the dispersion axis.

Finally, the automatically deduced width is checked to be greater than [min_spectrum_width].

Example: 

sptrim continuum.fits target.fits 0 200 0.1 100 5 215 out.fits
