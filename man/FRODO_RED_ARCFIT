Synopsis:

An automatic arc-line fitting routine.

Description:

The data is first cross correlated, with a maximum delay set by [max_cc_delay], on a row-by-row 
basis to remove the pixel-scale curvature. Candidate lines are then identified by:

1.	Finding the peaks on a row-by-row basis using the find_peaks function. The [min_dist],
 	[half_aperture_num_pix], [derivative_tol] and [derivative_tol_ref_px] parameters have their
	usual meanings as stated in the frfind blurb.

2.	Checking for line contiguity where [pix_tolerance] is the maximum number of
	pixels that the location of a single candidate line in a row is allowed to deviate from the
	other rows by before dismissing the line.

3.	Checking the average pixel channel of the contiguous lines against the reference arc line
 	list to identify matches. The maximum wavelength distance (in pixels) allowed for a peak to
 	be associated with that from the reference arc line list is [max_pix_diff].

The routine will fail if either the number of contiguous lines found is less than 
[min_contiguous_lines] or the number of lines matched to the reference file is less than 
[min_matched_lines]. 

A warning will be issued if it thinks the distribution of matched arc lines doesn't sample the 
wavelength range well, i.e. the average wavelength difference between the lines of the matched
line list does not lie within [max_av_wavelength_diff] of the average wavelength difference
between the lines of the reference arc list. It will also issue a warning if the chi squared
values indicate a suspect fit.

If successful, the program will produce a file [FRARCFIT_OUTPUTF_WAVFITS_FILE] containing the
polynomial fits determined for each fibre along with cross correlated arc [arc_file_ext_cc], 
target [target_file_ext_cc] and continuum [continuum_file_ext_cc] files.
