Synopsis:

Finds peaks (row-by-row) in a continuum FITS file.

Description:

Uses a peak finding routine that flags a peak if:

1.	[half_aperture_num_pix] pixels either side of pixel being considered have lesser values.

2.	The distance to the previous peak is greater than [min_dist].

3.	The intensity of the currently considered peak is greater than the value at the pixels
   	[der_tol_ref_px] either side by a tolerance value (see below).

Using the find_peaks function, the row data in [continuum_file] is cycled through a range of
derivative tolerances, starting at [der_tol_min] and ending at [der_tol_max], noting the best
value considered as the value giving the most number of rows with [FIBRES] number of peaks.

If successful, the program will produce a file [FRFIND_OUTPUTF_PEAKS_FILE] containing a list of
the centroids found using the find_centroid_parabolic function.

The program is terminated if the number of rows found is less than [min_rows].

Example: 

frfind continuum.fits 3 3 10 30 2 1000
